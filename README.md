## Autochecker Antispam & Checkbox Tool

This is a google chrome extension that attempts to automatically opt out of marketing email and sms subscriptions when filling out forms.

It also automatically accepts terms and conditions where possible.

#### Developing Locally

All source code files are in /src. Run 'npm run build' to build the dist folder, then just load the entire folder as an unpacked extension. [See how to load unpacked extensions here.](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)
